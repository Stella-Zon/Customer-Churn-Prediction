Customer Churn Prediction

Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. Churn prediction is critical for companies to understand which customers are likely to leave and take proactive measures to retain them. This project explores various aspects of data science, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

Project Structure
  •	Customer_Churn.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow of the project. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

Key Features
1.	Data Cleaning:
    
    •	Handling missing values.
  
    •	Encoding categorical variables.
  
    •	Scaling numerical features.
  
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   
    •	Visualizations to understand the distribution of data.
  
    •	Analysis of the relationship between features and the target variable.
3.	Feature Engineering:

    •	Creation of new features to improve model performance.
  
    •	Selection of the most relevant features using feature importance.
  
4.	Model Training:
   
    •	Implementation of various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
  
    •	Tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.
  
5.	Model Evaluation:
   
    •	Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate the models.
  
    •	Cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
  

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about customers and their interactions with the company. The features include demographic information, account details, and usage patterns. The target variable is a binary indicator of whether the customer has churned.
